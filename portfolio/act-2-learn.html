                <h5>Project Overview</h5>
                <p>While working at Trickster Theatre I was given the job of developing and designing the new Act2Learn.ca (previously the action learning institute). As the only person on the project I was tasked with creating a style guide for the brand (including new logo), transitioning all lesson plans from the old site, building in functionality that would allow users to create new accounts with the goal to eventually charge for the service and (of course) designing the new site.</p> <p>I picked Wordpress for the CMS because I was the most familiar with it at the time and figured I would be able to leverage its feature set on this project. Also the WordPress dashboard is pretty user friendly and customizable, which was key for being able to hand off the finished site and have non developers be able to easily add content over time. I also picked BootStrap as a framework so I would have a good foundation to design upon and not have to worry about building a custom grid system or anything like that.</p>

                <h5>Musings</h5>
                <p>I really got to flex my design and development muscles on this project. Me and the Wordpress API became much closer friends by the time Act2Learn launched in 2015. This was also the project on which I lost my Git and GitHub virginity. Even though I was the sole developer on the project, It was nice to have an on-line repo keeping track of my commits. Being able to create a branch to work on specific functionality and then merge it back to a master is an amazing feature and one I can't believe I lived without on other projects.</p> <p>Transitioning content from a website that was built in 2001 also posed an interesting learning experience. I originally was going to try and export some of the lesson plan data from the sites database, however, it turned out that the old site at one point had a forum built into it. Who ever built the site didn't implement any kind of spam protection on it though so the database turned ending up being a massive collection of porn ads and all sorts of nonsense. In the end it was faster to build a custom post type for the lesson plans and rebuild them all. </p>

                <p class="img-caption">Act2Learn's homepage was designed to be fun and colorful as well as give a quick overview of the product so that teachers or schools would sing-up to used the site.</p>

                <p class="img-caption">Because the site required a membership I had to write some PHP to dynamically change the navigation and homepage links to make it easier to access member content.</p>

                <p class="img-caption">I overrode the standard wordpress login/registration page with custom registration and login pages. I built a custom plug-in to achieve the requested functionality. The client wanted more information from the user when they signed up for a new account and I wanted more control over the design.</p>
